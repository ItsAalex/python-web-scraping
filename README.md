Inside web-scraping websites.ipynb file contains cells that contain scripts for scraping data from a different websites.
First cell is scraping the data from the website and saving it in csv.
Second cell is scraping the data by using selenium webdriver and saving it in csv.
Third cell is scraping the data by using user-agent and saving it in csv.
Also I was testing looker studio and I saved the file.
